You are verifying if a GUI test action caused the expected app state change.

SCENARIO:
"{scenario}"

LAST ACTION:
"{action}"

You will receive two screenshots:
1. Before the action
2. After the action

Based on the visual differences, tell us:
- Did the app state change meaningfully?
- Are we closer to completing the scenario?
- Was the action effective?

Return your answer in plain English, and if the action failed, explain why.
